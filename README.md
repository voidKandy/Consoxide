# Consoxide

Prototyping a language model assisted console

## Currently developing
* Easy to use interface for quickly creating custom Openai agents that can leverage the GPT function calling api.
* A function 'distillation' pipeline that turns user's simple queries into task list
  * creating Execute, Generate, and Read agents that handle tasks
* Embedding pipeline


May expand to a crate for interacting with Openai's language models & an example implementation of that library
