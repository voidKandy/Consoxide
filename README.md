# Simplifying Ai Agents in Rust ðŸ¦€
There are hundred of Ai agent applications written Typescript and Python. So this repo is an attempt to make doing the same in Rust just as approachable.

## Agent
**Agents** are easy to initialize structs which handle all database interractions as well as cached messages. Fully capable of adding/removing/editing files stored in a Postgres database. All files are chunkified and embedded for easy vector database querying. The **Agent** struct glues the **Context** and the **Gpt** structs together, allowing **Gpt** to query it's associated endpoint using the **Context**.
## Context
**Context** handles the relationship between the selected memory variant and the current message buffer. There are 3 memory variants: 
* Temporary - The message buffer exists only as long as it is in-scope
* ShortTerm - The message buffer persists for as long as the current runtime
* LongTerm - The message buffer persists until the database is cleared

## Current features
* Openai completions api easily accesible through an io device
* Agent which can switch Memory modes:
   * Temporary: for simple queries like file summaries or anything doesn't require a large context window
   * Short Term: the cached conversation for the current runtime
   * Long Term: Database connected Conversation
 * Memorable trait to make objects 'memorizable' by putting them in the context of a message

## In development
* Streaming completions
* SOPs
