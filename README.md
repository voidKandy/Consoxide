# Simplifying Ai Agents in Rust üïµüèº

Espionox is an attempt to make building Ai applications in Rust just as approachable as it is with other libraries such as LangChain.

## Why would I use Espionox?

- Making an LLM application in Rust
- Experimenting with with complex 'prompt flows' such as Chain/Tree of thought

## Getting started

First, you'll want to create an environment.

```
let open_key = std::env::var("OPENAI_KEY").unwrap();
let anth_key = std::env::var("ANTHROPIC_KEY").unwrap();

let mut keys = HashMap::new();
keys.insert(ModelProvider::OpenAi, api_key);
keys.insert(ModelProvider::Anthropic, api_key);

let env_name = "MyEnv";

Environment::new(Some(env_name), keys)
```

Once an `Environment` has been instantiated, you can add agents to it

```
let agent_name = "my agent";
let init_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant";
let handler = LLMCompletionHandler::<OpenAiCompletionHandler>::default_openai();
let agent = Agent::new(
    init_prompt,
    handler
);
let agent_handle = env.insert_agent(Some(agent_name), agent).await.unwrap();
```

When `insert_agent` returns Ok, it will return an `AgentHandler`
After inserting any Agents or EnvListeners run this command to start running the environment:

```
env.spawn().await.unwrap()
```

Once the environment is running, the `AgentHandler` can be used to make completion requests

```
let message = Message::new_user("Hello!");
let ticket = agent_handle.request_io_completion(message).await.unwrap();
```

Get the response to your completion requests with the returned `ticket` UUid

```
let noti = env.notifications.wait_for_notification(&ticket).await.unwrap();
let message: &Message = noti.extract_body().try_into().unwrap();
```

Completions can also be returned as streams if the `request_stream_completion` method is used:

```
let stream_handler: &ThreadSafeStreamCompletionHandler = noti.extract_body().try_into().unwrap();
let mut handler = stream_handler.lock().await;
let mut whole_message = String::new();
while let Some(CompletionStreamStatus::Working(token)) = handler
    .receive(&handle.id, environment.clone_sender())
    .await
{
    whole_message.push_str(&token);
}
println!("GOT WHOLE MESSAGE: {}", whole_message);
```

## Listeners

One of Espionox's best offerings is the EnvListener trait

```
pub trait EnvListener: std::fmt::Debug + Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Returns Some when the listener should be triggered
    fn trigger<'l>(&self, env_message: &'l EnvMessage) -> Option<&'l EnvMessage>;
    /// method to be called when listener is activated, must return an env message to replace input
    fn method<'l>(
        &'l mut self,
        trigger_message: EnvMessage,
        dispatch: &'l mut Dispatch,
    ) -> ListenerMethodReturn;
}
```
It looks simple, but this trait will allow you to create RAG pipelines, add tool use, and create self reflection techniques.
Think of the `EnvMessages` as events that can trigger specific things to happen to your agents.


espionox is very early in development and everything in the API may be subject to change
